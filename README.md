Please email the corresponding authors to discuss other ways to share the data.

The Repository is divided according to the two manuscripts, Challenges to transboundary fisheries management in North America under climate change (Labeled as "*Ecol*") and Climate change, shifting threat points and the management of transboundary fish stocks (labeled as "*Econ*").
